# 3-DoF-Helicopter

Contributers: Patrick Riedel, Iskandar Khemakhem and Lukas Worbs

This project deals with the systematic approach to solving a complex control engineering task. 
All steps, from mathematical modeling, through controller design and validation, to implementation on a real system, are undertaken. This approach is tested using the example of a three-degree-of-freedom helicopter. 
The resulting solution process is outlined below, and the results are presented in the protocoll (in German).

This project was part of a lab-work at the institute of system theory and automatic control (IST) a the university of Stuttgart (https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/de/lehre/lehrveranstaltungen/2022ws/pkrt/). 
The institute provided the hardware, supervizion, as well as a blackbox based simulation tool to test our results.
